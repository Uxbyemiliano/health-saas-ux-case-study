# Health SaaS Platform – UX Research & UX/UI Design Case Study

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on the redesign and usability improvement of a Health SaaS platform used by nutrition professionals across LATAM.  
My goal was to optimize clinical workflows, reduce cognitive load, and streamline task completion for healthcare practitioners.

I collaborated as a **UX Researcher & UX/UI Design Trainee**, applying qualitative research, usability testing, and high-fidelity prototyping.
